### Connect with an API using introduced patterns and approaches

For midterms, you will use AJAX handlers to create an interactive webpage. You will first create a way to accept user data (through forms, mouse actions or any other forms) and then capture an event action (form submit, button click , key press etc.) to collect that user data and use AJAX to send that data to an API of your choice.

You will then format the returned data (which will probably be in JSON format) and present the result or results in the DOM in a manner of your choice (diagrams, dataviz, animation etc.).

### Assignment Process

My assignment is fetching UN SDG(Sustainable Development Goals) API data and combining it with my CSV data to create a data visualization of different regions' SDG scores per goal.

The portion related to API fetching is as follows:

- Connect to UN SDG API to fetch description of goals
- Split description into two parts and create `<span>` for each part to be formatted differently
- Set up event listener so when a user clicks on the image of a goal, goal specific content will be updated
