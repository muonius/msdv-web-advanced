### Assignment
After the second review of your project, incorporate the feedback and refine your design. 

- Re-evaluate your visual design choices and refine all aspects of it in detail (pixel perfect design): Visualization method, composition, color, contrast, typography, hierarchy
- Fix outstanding bugs and missing features in the code version of your project
- Upload the working version of your project to your github.io page
- Create a set of 2-5 screenshots that work in a slide presentation (16:9, 1920x1080px) 
- Create a presentation about this project that describes the project
  - Initial motivation and question (1-3 slides, 1-2min)
  - Process (only if helpful, necessary)
  - Visualization (Still and in code)
  - Next steps, learnings and open questions

### Process Update
I took the feedback of my classmates and redesigned the dashboard. I eliminated all additional colors and will stick with the current SDG color palette which is already quite colorful. 

I also completed the below features as planned. Click [here](https://muons.com/msdv-major-studio-1/01_quantitative_project/) for the live project.

- Score grid rating
- Body text
- Hover over tooltip
- Generalize the code so users can toggle different goal metric
- Change the toggle to a horizontal scroll
- Highlight goal selected and mute unselected ones
